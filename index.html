        <h1>Let's cut straight to the chase:</h1>
        <p>The BloxyLeaks Website was a fun project that I was working on from time to time.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, as time goes on life does indeed get busier and busier.</p>
        <p>Which is currently the case. I currently have no time to put updates into the website.</p>
        <p>If nobody uses the website, then it makes no sense to continue hosting it.</p>
        <p>With all that being said, I will be archiving the website in 2 days.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
